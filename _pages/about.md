I am a Ph.D. student studying logic at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, advised by <a href="http://math.cmu.edu/~rami">Rami Grossberg</a>. Before I came to CMU, I obtained my BMath at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>. 

I am interested in abstract elementary classes (AECs), a generalization of elementary classes, i.e. classes of first order theories. Recently I wrote a [paper](publication/nip) on generalizing the notion of NIP to AECs.
