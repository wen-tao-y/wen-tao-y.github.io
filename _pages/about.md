I am a Ph.D. student studying logic at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, advised by <a href="http://math.cmu.edu/~rami">Rami Grossberg</a>. I came to CMU in 2019. Before that I obtained my BMath at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>. 

I am mainly interested in model theory and category theory.
