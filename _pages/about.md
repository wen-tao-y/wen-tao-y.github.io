I am a researcher at Inner Mongolia University. I got my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, advised by <a href="http://math.cmu.edu/~rami">Rami Grossberg</a>. 

I am interested in abstract elementary classes (AECs), a generalization of elementary classes, i.e. classes of first order theories. The next <a href="https://wen-tao-y.github.io/delta24/delta.html"> Delta Logic Workshop </a> will be held at Inner Mongolia University this September.
