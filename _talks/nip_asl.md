We propose an analogue definition of No Independence Property (NIP) for abstract
elementary classes (AECs) that coincides with NIP in first order model theory, where
the class is elementary. As we have no formulas in this context we work with Galois
types. We construct a forking-like relation on AECs with NIP. Our work can be viewed
as a new chapter in the neo-stability of AECs, building on Armida-Mazariâ€™s work
